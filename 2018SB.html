  <!-- <h3>Applications are now closed for the 2018 NYC Gaia Sprint</h3> -->
  <!-- <p>If you applied, <i>you should have received email</i> by now
     letting you know whether you have been admitted to the Sprint.
     Let us know if you did not receive that email.
     Apologies to those we could not admit: We were highly over-subscribed!</p> -->

  <h3>Schedule and Location</h3>
  <p> The 2018 <b>Santa Barbara Satellite</b> meeting will take place at the
    University of California, Santa Barbara from 2018 June 04 to June 08,
    inclusive, in concert with the official <a href="2018NYC.html">NYC Sprint</a>.</p>
  <p>On the first day, all participants will present a slide from the jointly 
     edited <a href="https://bit.ly/2J60GDi">2018 Santa Barbara Gaia Sprint 
     <b>Pitch Slides</b></a> to introduce themselves, their skills, expertise,
     and their ideas for the week.</p>

  <h3>Local Organizing Committee</h3>
  <ul><li><b>Juna Kollmeier</b> (Carnegie)</li>
      <li><b>David W. Hogg</b> (NYU) (MPIA) (Flatiron)</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p> In organizing the Satellite Sprint, we hope to 1) open the
  Gaia Sprint experience up to a larger audience, and 2) experiment
  with new ways of hosting engaging and useful collaborations in
  distributed locations simultaneously. The same objectives and rules
  of collaboration and participation apply at the Satellite Sprint. </p>

  <p>The idea behind the Sprints is to bring together people who
    have an interest in timely scientific investigation and use
    of the <i>Gaia</i> Data.  These are not traditional
    scientific meetings; they are intended to facilitate
    completion of first scientific papers.  The Sprints are
    structured to support collaborative refinement and execution
    of (fairly) mature scientific ideas.  It is hoped that new
    partnerships will form and lead to co-authored publications
    for the scientific literature ready or near-ready by the end
    of each Sprint.</p>


<h3>Collaboration Policy</h3>
  <p><i>In addition to a general <a href="codeofconduct.html">Code
    of Conduct</a>, we require participants to agree to a
    Collaboration Policy that ensures transparency and openness
    at the Sprints:</i></p>
  <p>All participants at every Gaia Sprint will be expected to openly
    share their ideas, expertise, code, and interim results.
    Project development will proceed out in the open, among
    participants and in the world.</p>
  <p>Participants will be encouraged to change gears, start new
    collaborations, and combine projects.  Any participant who
    contributes significantly to a project can expect
    co-authorship on resulting scientific papers, and any
    participant who gets signficant contributions to a project
    is expected to include those contributors as co-authors.</p>
  <p>These rules make it <i>inadvisable to bring proprietary
    data sets or proprietary code</i> to any Sprint, unless the
    participant bringing such assets has the rights to open them
    or add collaborators.</p>
