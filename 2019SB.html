  <p>Applications to attend the 2019 Santa Barbara Gaia
  Sprint are <b>closed</b>. If you applied, you will soon receive an email
  from the organizers.
  </p>

  <p>There is a self-organised Satellite Sprint being held at the same time at the
    University of Oxford. Registrations for the
    <a href="2019OXF.html">2019 Gaia Sprint: Oxford Satellite</a>
  will remain open until 2019 January 20.

  <h3>Schedule and Location</h3>
    <p>The 2019 Santa Barbara Gaia Sprint will take place

  <h3>Objectives</h3>
    <p>The idea behind the Sprints is to bring together people who
    have an interest in timely scientific investigation and use
    of the <i>Gaia</i> Data.  These are not traditional
    scientific meetings; they are intended to facilitate
    completion of first scientific papers.  The Sprints are
    structured to support collaborative refinement and execution
    of (fairly) mature scientific ideas.  It is hoped that new
    partnerships will form and lead to co-authored publications
    for the scientific literature ready or near-ready by the end
    of each Sprint.</p>

  <h3>Collaboration Policy</h3>
    <p><i>In addition to a general <a href="codeofconduct.html">Code
    of Conduct</a>, we require participants to agree to a
    Collaboration Policy that ensures transparency and openness
    at the Sprints:</i></p>
    <p>All participants at every Gaia Sprint will be expected to openly
    share their ideas, expertise, code, and interim results.
    Project development will proceed out in the open, among
    participants and in the world.</p>
    <p>Participants will be encouraged to change gears, start new
    collaborations, and combine projects.  Any participant who
    contributes significantly to a project can expect
    co-authorship on resulting scientific papers, and any
    participant who gets signficant contributions to a project
    is expected to include those contributors as co-authors.</p>
    <p>These rules make it <i>inadvisable to bring proprietary
    data sets or proprietary code</i> to any Sprint, unless the
    participant bringing such assets has the rights to open them
    or add collaborators.</p>
