	<p>If you are interested in attending the <b>2017 Heidelberg Gaia
	  Sprint</b>, please [fill out and submit this registration form /
	  TBD].</p>

        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <p>The idea behind the Sprints is to bring together people who
          have an interest in timely scientific investigation and use
          of the <i>Gaia</i> Data.  These are not traditional
          scientific meetings; they are intended to facilitate
          completion of first scientific papers.  The Sprints are
          structured to support collaborative refinement and execution
          of (fairly) mature scientific ideas.  It is hoped that new
          partnerships will form and lead to co-authored publications
          for the scientific literature ready or near-ready by the end
          of each Sprint.</p>

	<h2>Collaboration Policy</h2>
	<p><i>In addition to a general <a href="codeofconduct.html">Code
	  of Conduct</a>, we require participants to agree to a
	  Collaboration Policy that ensures transparency and openness
	  at the Sprints:</i></p>
	<p>All participants at every Gaia Sprint will be expected to openly
	  share their ideas, expertise, code, and interim results.
	  Project development will proceed out in the open, among
	  participants and in the world.</p>
	<p>Participants will be encouraged to change gears, start new
	  collaborations, and combine projects.  Any participant who
	  contributes significantly to a project can expect
	  co-authorship on resulting scientific papers, and any
	  participant who gets signficant contributions to a project
	  is expected to include those contributors as co-authors.</p>
	<p>These rules make it <i>inadvisable to bring proprietary
	  data sets or proprietary code</i> to any Sprint, unless the
	  participant bringing such assets has the rights to open them
	  or add collaborators.</p>
