        <h2>Heidelberg Gaia Sprint</h2>
	<p><b>2016 August 08 through 12</b></p>
        <p>At the <a href="http://www.haus-der-astronomie.de/">Haus der Astronomie</a>

        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <p>The idea behind the Sprints is to bring together people who
          have an interest in timely exploitation of the <i>Gaia First
          Data Release</i>.  They are intended to facilitate work
          towards first papers: These are meetings of doers.  The
          meetings will be structured to support collaborative
          refinement and execution of (fairly) mature scientific
          ideas.  It is hoped that new partnerships will form at the
          meetings and lead to co-authored publications for the
          scientific literature ready or near-ready by the end of each
          Sprint.</p>
	<p>Currently, everything we know about the <i>Gaia</i>
	  data-release plans is
	  <a href="http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/release">here</a>.</p>

	<h2>Organizing Committee</h2>
	<ul><li>Ana Bonaca (Yale)</li>
	    <li>David W. Hogg (SCDA) (NYU)</li>
	    <li>Hans-Walter Rix (MPIA)</li>
	    <li>David Spergel (CCA)</li>
	</ul>
        
	<h2>Application and Registraton</h2>
	<p>Attendance will be limited.  Participant selection will be
	  based on project descriptions submitted as part of an
	  application form.  We hope to obtain a balance of scientific
	  subjects, technical abilities, and demographics.</p>
	<p><i>Watch this space</i> for application instructions.</p>

	<h2>Travel and Lodging</h2>
	<p>Participants will be expected to make their own travel and
	  lodging arrangements.</p>
	<p>The Sprints do not have financial support to help with
	  travel, but let the organizers know if there is absolutely
	  no way you could participate without support and we can help
	  explore options.</p>
