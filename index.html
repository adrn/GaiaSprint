        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <p>The idea behind the Sprints is to bring together people who
          have an interest in timely exploitation of the <i>Gaia First
          Data Release</i>.  They are not traditional scientific
          meetings; they are intended to facilitate completion of
          first scientific papers.  The Sprints will be structured to
          support collaborative refinement and execution of (fairly)
          mature scientific ideas.  It is hoped that new partnerships
          will form and lead to co-authored publications for the
          scientific literature ready or near-ready by the end of each
          Sprint.</p>
	<p>Currently, <i>everything we know about the <i>Gaia</i>
	  data-release plans is
	  <a href="http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/release">here</a>.</i></p>

	<h2>Organizing Committee</h2>
	<ul><li>Ana Bonaca (Yale)</li>
	    <li>David W. Hogg (SCDA) (NYU) (MPIA)</li>
	    <li>Adrian Price-Whelan (Columbia)</li>
	    <li>Hans-Walter Rix (MPIA)</li>
	    <li>David Spergel (CCA) (Princeton)</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Collaboration Policies</h2>
	<p>All participants at the Sprints will be expected to openly
	  share their ideas, expertise, code, and interim results.
	  Project development will proceed out in the open, among
	  participants and in the world.</p>
	<p>Participants will be encouraged to change gears, start new
	  collaborations, and combine projects.  Any participant who
	  contributes significantly to a project can expect
	  co-authorship on resulting scientific papers, and any
	  participant who gets signficant contributions to a project
	  is expected to include those contributors as co-authors.</p>
	<p>These rules make it <i>inadvisable to bring proprietary
	  data sets or proprietary code</i> to the Sprints, unless the
	  participant bringing such assets has the rights to open them
	  or add collaborators.</p>
        
	<h2>Application and Registraton</h2>
	<p>Attendance will be limited.  Participant selection will be
	  based on project descriptions submitted as part of an
	  application form.  We hope to obtain a balance of scientific
	  subjects, technical abilities, and demographics.</p>
	<p><i>Watch this space</i> for application instructions.</p>

	<h2>Travel and Lodging</h2>
	<p>Participants will be expected to make their own travel and
	  lodging arrangements.  If you need a letter of invitation,
	  let the organizers know.</p>
	<p>The Sprints do not have financial support to help with
	  travel, but let the organizers know if there is absolutely
	  no way you could participate without support and we can help
	  explore options.</p>
