<h2>2016 NYC Gaia Sprint</h2><a id="2016NYC"></a>

  <p><i>This page preserves the history from the 2016 NYC Gaia Sprint.</i></p>

  <h3>Results</h3>
  <p>Before and during the meeting, we kept jointly edited
    <a href="http://dwh.gg/GaiaSprintNotes">2016 NYC Gaia Sprint <b>Running Notes</b></a>
    that gathered information about homework
    solutions, intended projects, project progress, and
    breakouts.</p>
  <p>On the last day, the wrap-up was given from a jointly
    edited set of
    <a href="http://dwh.gg/GaiaSprintWrapUp">2016 NYC Gaia Sprint <b>Wrap-up Slides</b></a>,
        which <i>incredibly telegraphically</i> summarize the
    accomplishments of the participants.</p>
