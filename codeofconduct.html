<h2>Gaia Sprint Codes of Conduct</h2><a id="2016NYC"></a>

  <p><i>There are two codes of conduct applicable to the Gaia Sprints.</i></p>

  <h3>General Code of Conduct</h3>
  <p>The Gaia Sprints organizers are dedicated to providing a
    harassment-free conference experience for everyone,
    regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age,
    sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body
    size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or
    technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of
    conference participants in any form. Sexual language and
    imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue,
    including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other
    online media. Participants violating these rules may be
    sanctioned or expelled from the Gaia Sprint without a refund
    at the discretion of the conference organizers.</p>
  <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to
    gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual
    orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size,
    race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images
    in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking,
    following, harassing photography or recording, sustained
    disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical
    contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
  <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are
    expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in
    harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they
    deem appropriate, including warning the offender or
    expulsion from the Gaia Sprint with no refund.</p>
  <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is
    being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact
    an organizer immediately. Organizers will be happy to help
    participants contact local law enforcement, provide escorts,
    or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel
    safe for the duration of the Gaia Sprint. We value your
    attendance.</p>
  <p>We expect participants to follow these rules during the
    Gaia Sprint and during related social events.</p>

  <h3>Collaboration Policy</h3>
  <p>All participants at every Gaia Sprint will be expected to openly
    share their ideas, expertise, code, and interim results.
    Project development will proceed out in the open, among
    participants and in the world.</p>
  <p>Participants will be encouraged to change gears, start new
    collaborations, and combine projects.  Any participant who
    contributes significantly to a project can expect
    co-authorship on resulting scientific papers, and any
    participant who gets signficant contributions to a project
    is expected to include those contributors as co-authors.</p>
  <p>These rules make it <i>inadvisable to bring proprietary
    data sets or proprietary code</i> to any Sprint, unless the
    participant bringing such assets has the rights to open them
    or add collaborators.</p>
