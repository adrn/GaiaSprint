<h2>2018 DR2 Zero-Day workshop</h2><a id="2018HD"></a>

  <p><i>This page preserves the history from the 2018 Gaia DR2 Zero-Day Workshop
        which took place 2018 April 25 through 27 at the
        <a href="http://flatironinstitute.org/">Flatiron Institute</a>,
        a division of the <a href="https://simonsfoundation.org/">Simons Foundation</a>.</i></p>

  <h3>Results</h3>
  <p>This meeting was improvised last-minute, but ended up with over 70 participants.
     The workshop has in part resulted in the following publications:</p>

    <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01573">Off the beaten path: <i>Gaia</i> reveals GD-1 stars outside of the main stream</a>,

  </ul>

<h3>Objectives</h3>
  <p>The idea behind the Workshop was to develop
    timely scientific investigations with
    the <i>Gaia</i> Data.</p>

<h3>Collaboration Policy</h3>
  <p><i>In addition to a general <a href="codeofconduct.html">Code
    of Conduct</a>, the workshop ran under a
    Collaboration Policy that ensures transparency and openness
    at the Sprints:</i></p>
  <p>All participants at every Gaia Sprint will be expected to openly
    share their ideas, expertise, code, and interim results.
    Project development will proceed out in the open, among
    participants and in the world.</p>
  <p>Participants will be encouraged to change gears, start new
    collaborations, and combine projects.  Any participant who
    contributes significantly to a project can expect
    co-authorship on resulting scientific papers, and any
    participant who gets signficant contributions to a project
    is expected to include those contributors as co-authors.</p>
  <p>These rules make it <i>inadvisable to bring proprietary
    data sets or proprietary code</i> to any Sprint, unless the
    participant bringing such assets has the rights to open them
    or add collaborators.</p>

  <h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
    <p>We ask that any publications that were started or worked on
      during this Workshop include the following acknowledgements:</p>
